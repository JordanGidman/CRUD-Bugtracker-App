# CRUD-Bugtracker-App
This is a feature rich bug tracking application allowing for multiple users of multiple teams to create, read, update and delete bugs. The site uses firebase on the back-end to make the bugs persistent.

DISCLAIMER: This is a project i made a while ago now that i had forgotten to commit here a long with a few other projects i had only been commiting to the main branch without publishing the 
main here for viewing as well which i will be adding. Which is why unlike my most recent projects this does not utilize react. 

This was my first project using firebase at all and the need to keep data persistant for this application is what forced me to go and find a solution for that. At the time i was not aware of how powerful firebase is and so 
i did not use firebase auth for the login as i should have i instead built one from scratch myself so unfortunately there is no encryption going on for the passwords and i would please keep that in mind when making a login.

HOW TO USE: 
Please login with the username and password set to "guest". Then in the teamcode box at the top right type "hireme" and click join. Then you can click on any of the team members on the left and click "Team Tasks" to see 
bugs from your other team members. or use the site as you wish from there to create bugs delete bugs etc. Please bare in mind that if there are any bugs existing for the guest account they will have been created by
another potential employer that has used it. I have them set to wipe every so often but you may still see some there so if you do they were not made by me please bare that in mind.
